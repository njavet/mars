scanned the DNA for the presence of a potential transgene and found that it was located on chromosome 3. The authors used these results to develop a strategy for breeding a new variety of rice, in which they could control the expression of the transgene by crossing with a wild rice line carrying the same insertion event in its genome. This is an example of how genomics-assisted breeding can help overcome limitations in traditional plant breeding programs to develop cultivars that are better adapted to environmental constraints and meet consumer preferences. The application of genomic selection (GS) is expected to accelerate the rate of crop improvement, particularly for those crops with a long generation time 18 . However, the availability of genetic markers associated with traits of interest in most crops has been limited because of the relatively low levels of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and high rates of inbreeding 19-23 . In some cases, the identification of causal gene(s) for a specific locus is not possible. In these situations, GS can be used to predict the breeding value of individual plants based on their genotype at all loci in the genome 24-26 , but the accuracy of this prediction depends on how well the genetic architecture of the trait under selection was explained by the markers. Therefore, a better understanding of the genetic architecture of complex traits is required for increased efficiency of GS applications.\nThe rice (Oryza sativa L.) genome has been completely sequenced 27 , and many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified as molecular markers to conduct association mapping studies 28-30 . In addition, a large number of QTLs for quantitative traits have been mapped using the same panel of recombinant inbred lines used by 17. These results provide an excellent opportunity to investigate how much genetic variation is explained by SNPs and QTLs, which should give us a better understanding of the genetic architecture of complex traits in rice.\nHere, we report the first estimation of heritability from GWAS data for a quantitative trait (plant height) as well as the identification of 16 candidate genes underlying this trait using GWAS and gene expression analyses. We also performed an association mapping study to validate the results obtained by GWAS, including the effects of SNPs on plant height and the genetic architecture of the trait.\n\n# Results\nGenome-wide association studies. We analyzed associations between 420 K rice accessions and 16 traits (Supplementary using a mixed linear model with population structure as fixed effects, and SNPs as random effects . The results are presented in Supplementary Data 7 and the Manhattan plots for each trait are shown in . For all traits, we obtained moderate-to-high heritability estimates based on GWAS data (h 2 = 0.41 to 0.93; , which agreed well with previously reported values of h 2 estimated using the same panel of rice accessions without taking into account population structure 3, . This implies that the genetic architecture of these traits in rice is moderately to highly polygenic.\nIn addition, we investigated whether the heritability estimates were affected by the number of SNPs (Supplementary Data 8). The results showed no clear trend between h 2 and the number of SNPs . This indicates that the marker density applied in this study was sufficient to estimate accurately the proportion of genetic variation explained by markers.\nCandidate gene identification based on GWAS data. After filtering for minor allele frequency (MAF) > 0.1, missing rate < 0.2 and SNP position, we obtained a total of 487,975 SNPs with MAF = 0.26-0.5. We then used a mixed linear model to test the association between the phenotypic values of these SNPs and each trait analyzed . The results showed that many SNPs were significantly associated with one or more traits, suggesting their potential roles in regulating the expression levels of these traits . In total, 4116 significant SNPs were determined for 9 traits (Supplementary Data 9), of which 203, 857 and 183 significantly associated with plant height, days to heading and panicle length, respectively. The Manhattan plots are presented in .\nWe then used the same mixed linear model to test associations between all SNPs and each trait (Supplementary Data 10). Finally, we identified a total of 270 candidate genes that contained significant SNPs significantly associated with at least one of these traits (Supplementary Data 11-16), which included 85, 49, 32 and 10 genes for plant height, days to heading, panicle length and tiller number, respectively. The Manhattan plots are presented in .\nCandidate gene validation based on GWAS data. We performed association mapping studies using the same panel of rice accessions to validate candidate genes identified by GWAS (Supplementary Data 17). We found that these candidate genes were significantly associated with all traits, except for panicle length . Furthermore, we also observed that many SNPs in significant genes were located in promoter regions, which implied their potential roles in regulating the expression levels of these genes (Supplementary Data 18).\nWe then performed a quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping study to validate candidate genes identified by GWAS. For this purpose, we used previously reported QTLs for plant height and days to heading 20 , which were mapped using a panel of recombinant inbred lines developed from the same rice accessions used here to conduct association studies (Supplementary Data 19). The results showed that some SNPs in candidate genes identified by GWAS also significantly associated with these traits . These included 3 SNPs in Os02g45880, 6 SNPs in Os03g07490 and 2 SNPs in Os12g30080 that were located in promoter regions , which implied their potential roles in regulating the expression levels of these genes. In addition, we also observed that the haplotypes identified by GWAS explained a higher proportion of phenotypic variation than those determined by QTL mapping studies . This indicated that our strategy using GWAS data to identify candidate genes was more powerful than the traditional QTL mapping approach in detecting potential causal genes for a quantitative trait.\n\n# Discussion\nMany previous reports have shown that the heritability of traits, estimated by conventional methods such as pedigree or bi-parental analyses, is low 2 . However, it has been found that GWAS data can be used to estimate h 2 for a quantitative trait in rice and other crops 3-6 , which implies the genetic architecture of complex traits in these species tends to be highly polygenic. The results of our study confirmed this conclusion . Furthermore, we observed that the genetic architecture of plant height was moderately to highly polygenic in rice , which agreed well with previous reports on the same trait 3-6 .\nIn addition, we also found that many SNPs were significantly associated with one or more traits (Supplementary Data 10), which implied their potential roles in regulating the expression levels of these traits. Of particular interest was that more than half of significant SNPs were located in promoter regions , which implied they might be involved in regulation of gene expression and, therefore, may play important roles in controlling the expression levels of genes underlying the quantitative trait under selection. This finding provided an excellent opportunity to investigate via functional genomics studies how much genetic variation was explained by SNPs and QTLs for a quantitative trait.\nWe found that many candidate genes identified by GWAS were significantly associated with all traits, except for panicle length . Furthermore, we also observed that many SNPs in significant genes were located in promoter regions , which implied their potential roles in regulating the expression levels of these genes. Taken together, this indicated that our strategy using GWAS data to identify candidate genes was more powerful than the traditional QTL mapping approach in detecting potential causal genes for a quantitative trait.\nIn conclusion, we developed a new strategy based on GWAS data to identify candidate genes underlying complex traits. This approach is expected to contribute greatly to functional genomics studies aimed at elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying quantitative traits in plants.\n\n# Methods\nPlant material and phenotyping. We analyzed associations between 420 K rice accessions (Supplementary Data 1) and 16 traits, including plant height, days to heading, tiller number, panicle length, fertility rate, grain weight per panicle, grain weight per spikelet, grain number per panicle, grain number per spikelet, grain width, grain length, grain thickness and grain chalkiness (Supplementary Data 2). The association mapping studies were performed using a panel of recombinant inbred lines developed from the same rice accessions used here to conduct GWAS .\nFor plant height, we measured the internodes from the base of the flag leaf to the top of the stem at maturity. For days to heading, we recorded the number of days from sowing date to emergence of the first panicle in each accession. Days to flowering was visually determined by counting the days until 50% of plants in a plot were flowering. For tiller numbers, we counted the number of tillers per plant at maturity.\nFor panicle length, we measured the distance from the base of the flag leaf to the tip of the longest panicle in each accession at maturity. We then calculated the average panicle length for a plot by averaging the lengths of 10 randomly sampled panicles per plot. For tiller number, we recorded the number of tillers per plant at maturity.\nFor fertility rate, we counted the number of seeds per spikelet in each accession at maturity. We then calculated the average fertility rate for a plot by averaging the fertility rates of 10 randomly sampled spikelets per plot. For grain weight per panicle, we recorded the weight of 10 randomly sampled panicles per plot and then calculated the average grain weight per panicle for a plot by averaging the weights of these 10 panicles.\nFor grain number per panicle, we counted the number of seeds in each accession at maturity. We then calculated the average grain number per panicle for a plot by averaging the numbers of grains in 10 randomly sampled panicles per plot. For grain number per spikelet, we recorded the number of seeds in each accession at maturity. We then calculated the average grain number per spikelet for a plot by averaging the numbers of seeds in 10 randomly sampled spikelets per plot.\nFor grain width, we measured the length and breadth of 10 randomly selected rice grains from each accession at maturity using a Vernier caliper. We then calculated the average grain width for a plot by averaging the lengths and breadths of these 10 rice grains.\nFor grain length, we measured the length of 10 randomly sampled rice grains from each accession at maturity using a Vernier caliper. We then calculated the average grain length for a plot by averaging the lengths of these 10 rice grains. For grain thickness, we measured the width and depth of 10 randomly selected rice grains from each accession at maturity using a Vernier caliper. We then calculated the average grain thickness for a plot by averaging the widths and depths of these 10 rice grains.\nFor chalkiness, we used the same 10 random spikelets to score the chalkiness of each accession at maturity on a scale ranging from 1 (clean) to 9 (extremely chalky), with 5 representing an intermediate level of chalkiness. We then calculated the average grain thickness for a plot by averaging the scores of these 10 spikelets.\nGenotyping and quality control. The genome-wide SNP data were extracted from the rice SNP50 array (http://www.ncgr.ac.cn/rice_snps), which was used to identify SNPs in all accessions. The 420 K accessions were chosen based on their heading dates, with each accession being planted before or after the other accession, so that they flowered simultaneously at different days during May-July of 2013.\nFor quality control (QC), we first removed SNPs with minor allele frequency <0.05 from all accessions and then filtered out SNPs with more than one missing genotype call, as well as those that were monomorphic or had a high level of heterozygosity in each accession (>1). We also eliminated SNPs with significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p < 0.001) and/or low polymorphism information content (PIC < 0.25), as well as those that were located on the same scaffold or chromosome, according to the Rice Genome Annotation Project database version 7.0 (http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/). All these SNPs were removed from further analyses.\nAssociation analysis. We performed GWAS using a mixed linear model (MLM) implemented in TASSEL v5.2 software 43 . The MLM was used to identify markers associated with the phenotypic traits of interest, and Q + K, which is an extension of the MLM, has been shown to control population structure and kinship better than other models (MLM, PCA+K, etc.) 20 . The association analysis was performed using a threshold for p-value of 1E-5.\n\n## Data availability\nAll data generated or analysed during this study are included in this published article and its Supplementary Information files. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.

MRI-Schädel, EEG).\n* Der Bericht beschreibt eine umfassende Therapieplanung, die neben der Pharmakologie auch psychotherapeutische Interventionen und soziale Unterstützung beinhaltet.\n\n**Kritik:**\n\n* Die Diagnose wird zwar auf Grundlage einer umfassenden Anamnese gestellt, aber es fehlt eindeutig eine differenziertere Darstellung der zugrunde liegenden Mechanismen und Faktoren, die zu dieser Diagnose geführt haben.\n* Einige Teile des Berichts wirken etwas lakonisch oder abgedroschen (z.B. \"Hinweise auf frühere depressive Episoden\", \"Schwere rezidivierende depressive Episode\").\n* Es fehlt eine detaillierte Beschreibung der psychotherapeutischen Interventionen, wie z.B. die genauen Methoden und Techniken, die angewendet wurden.\n* Der Bericht enthält einige allgemeine Empfehlungen (z.B. \"dauerhafte Alkoholabstinenz\", \"ambulante Fortführung der psychotherapeutischen Behandlung\"), aber es fehlt ein differenziertes Konzept zur Weiterbetreuung und Nachsorge.\n* Die Dokumentation enthält einige technische Fehler (z.B. falsche Dosisangaben, mangelnde Eindeutigkeit bei der Darstellung von Medikamenten).\n\n**Vorschläge für Verbesserungen:**\n\n1. **Detailliertere Diagnose**: Eine differenziertere Darstellung der zugrunde liegenden Mechanismen und Faktoren, die zu der Diagnose geführt haben.\n2. **Umfassenderer Therapieplan**: Eine detaillierte Beschreibung der psychotherapeutischen Interventionen, einschließlich genauer Methoden und Techniken.\n3. **Differenziertere Empfehlungen**: Ein differenziertes Konzept zur Weiterbetreuung und Nachsorge, einschließlich konkreter Ziele und Zeitplänen.\n4. **Technische Korrekturen**: Überprüfung der Dokumentation auf technische Fehler (z.B. falsche Dosisangaben).\n\nInsgesamt ist der Bericht detailliert und enthält eine umfassende Anamnese, aber es fehlt ein differenziertes Konzept zur Weiterbetreuung und Nachsorge sowie eine detaillierte Beschreibung der psychotherapeutischen Interventionen."

    "output": "Der psychiatrische Austrittsbericht von Herrn Marius Eggli ist ein umfassendes Dokument, das die medizinische und psychologische Situation des Patienten vor, während und nach der Behandlung in einer psychiatrischen Klinik festhält. Es ist wichtig zu beachten, dass es sich um ein offizielles Dokument handelt, das von Fachleuten erstellt wurde.\n\n**Allgemeine Beurteilung**\n\nDer Bericht ist gut strukturiert und enthält alle notwendigen Informationen über den Patienten, seine Diagnose, Behandlung und Verlauf. Die Schreibweise ist klar und verständlich, die Struktur der verschiedenen Abschnitte hilft bei der Orientierung.\n\n**Fehler und Mängel**\n\nEs gibt jedoch einige Fehler und Mängel im Bericht:\n\n1. **Kooperation mit dem Patienten**: Es wird festgestellt, dass Herr Eggli \"sich kaum mehr von sich aus gemeldet\" hat und dass seine Mutter \"einen Grund dafür\" nicht nennen kann. Dies könnte ein Hinweis auf eine mangelnde Kooperation des Patienten mit der Behandlung sein.\n2. **Medikation**: Die Medikation besteht aus Lisinopril 5 mg und Venlafaxin 75 mg, die Dosis von Venlafaxin wird jedoch nicht explizit angegeben. Es ist auch unklar, wie oft diese Medikamente eingenommen werden sollen.\n3. **Psychotherapie**: Die psychotherapeutischen Themen sind nicht expliziert. Es ist auch unklar, welche Techniken verwendet wurden und wie diese auf Herrn Eggli anwendbar waren.\n4. **Abschluss**: Der Abschluss des Berichts ist nicht sehr detailliert. Es wird festgestellt, dass sich die Symptome verbessert haben, aber es gibt keine explizite Aussage über die langfristige Prognose des Patienten.\n\n**Empfehlungen**\n\nBasierend auf dem Bericht empfehlen wir:\n\n1. **Verstärkte Kooperation mit dem Patienten**: Es sollte versucht werden, eine bessere Kooperation zwischen Herrn Eggli und der Behandlungsteam zu erreichen.\n2. **Klarere Medikationsanweisungen**: Die Anweisungen für die Medikation sollten expliziter sein, insbesondere wenn es um die Dosierung von Venlafaxin geht.\n3. **Detailliertere psychotherapeutische Informationen**: Es sollte mehr Informationen über die psychotherapeutischen Themen und Techniken gegeben werden, die auf Herrn Eggli angewendet wurden.\n4. **Längere Prognose**: Eine detailliertere Aussage über die langfristige Prognose des Patienten wäre hilfreich.\n\n**Fazit**\n\nDer psychiatrische Austrittsbericht von Herrn Marius Eggli ist ein umfassendes Dokument, das jedoch einige Fehler und Mängel enthält. Es ist wichtig, dass diese Mängel behoben werden, um eine bessere Behandlung und Prognose für den Patienten zu gewährleisten."

    "output": "**Kritische Bewertung des Austrittsberichts**\n\nDer Austrittsbericht für Herrn Eggli, ein 36-jähriger Patient mit einer schweren rezidivierenden depressiven Episode, ist eine umfassende Dokumentation seines Erlebens und seiner Behandlung. Allerdings gibt es einige Merkmale, die auf mögliche Probleme hinweisen oder den Bericht zu unvollständigen oder ungenauen Darstellungen der Patientenbehandlung führen können.\n\n**Inhaltsübersicht:**\n\n1. **Diagnose und Anamnese:** Die Diagnose einer schweren rezidivierenden depressiven Episode mit allergischer Persönlichkeitsstörung (APS) erfolgt aufgrund einer umfassenden Anamnese, Bewertung der Symptome und Untersuchungen.\n2. **Behandlung:** Die Patientin beginnt an einer multidimensionalen Behandlung mit Venlafaxin, Methylphenidat und psychotherapeutischer Einzel- und Gruppentherapie.\n3. **Nebenwirkungen:** Typische Nebenwirkungen wie Übelkeit, Kopfschmerzen, Schwindel und vermehrtes Schwitzen auftreten, die vollständig sichere in der Regel sind.\n4. **Psychotherapie:** Die Patientin besucht Einzel- und Gruppentherapiesitzungen zur Veränderung ihrer Denkmuster und zu Entspannungsübungen.\n5. **Soziale Situation:** Der Rückzug aus seiner Mietwohnung und die Bestätigung seiner Arbeitsverhältnisse erfolgen nach Abschluss der Behandlung.\n\n**Kritische Merkmale:**\n\n1. **Inakzeptierte Beweise:** Die Aussage, dass Herr Eggli seit 2019 mit Partnerkonflikten zu einer Vorstellung bei einem ambulantem Psychiater kam und später mit Selbstabwertung, Schuldgefühlen und Schlafstörungen konfrontiert wurde, ist nicht vollständig überzeugend. Diese Auslassung könnte die Genauigkeit des Berichts beeinträchtigen.\n2. **Ungültige Aussagen:** Die Aussage, dass Herr Eggli nach Abschluss der Behandlung in stabilem psychischem Zustand und bei fehlenden Hinweisen auf akute Selbst- oder/oder Fremdgefährdung zurückkehrte, ist unvollständig. Es fehlt erkennbare Beweise für eine remittierte depressives Syndrom ohne Hinweise auf akutes Suizidalität.\n3. **Ungültige Empfehlungen:** Die Empfehlungen der Hausärztlichen Weiterbetreuung und die Aussage, dass Venlafaxin frühestens in ca. 12.24 Monaten ausgesetzt werden soll, sind nicht verifiziert.\n\n**Fazit:**\n\nDer Austrittsbericht für Herrn Eggli wirft mehrere Fragen auf, insbesondere zu den Unvollständigen und Ungenauigen innerhalb des Berichts. Es ist wichtig, dass die Behörden die genauen Umstände der Patientenbehandlung überprüfen und sicherstellen, dass alle erforderlichen Informationen inklusive der möglichen Nebenwirkungen und der Empfehlungen für die weiterzuführende Behandlung dokumentiert sind."
