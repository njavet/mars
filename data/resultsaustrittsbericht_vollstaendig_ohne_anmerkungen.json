The specimens' NVB was isolated from the TMJ region and then scanned using a high definition CT (HDCT) machine.

It is a complex anatomical structure that can be damaged by trauma or overuse from bruxism, which leads to internal derangements of the joints. These, in turn, can lead to disorders such as arthralgia, myalgia, temporalis muscle hypertrophy, and chronic pain (1). Reconstructive surgery has been used for these cases with good results (2), but it is not always easy due to the complex anatomy of this region. The neurovascular bundle (NVB) in the TMJ region is made up of the external carotid artery, internal carotid artery, and adjacent branches that go directly into the joint capsule and are surrounded by the periosteum of the temporal bone and the temporalis muscle. This study aims to produce anatomical models for surgery using 3D printing methods as well as to evaluate the feasibility of such a model in the TMJ region. </|p><|b id=\"t00672e1\"><|p>Materials and Methods<|p>The cadaveric specimens were obtained from the Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine Vajira Hospital, Navamindradhiraj University, Bangkok, Thailand. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee in Human Research (COA no. 142-58). The NVB was dissected from each specimen and then scanned by a high definition computed tomography (HDCT) machine (Philips Brilliance 16-slice; Philips Medical Systems, Best, Netherlands), with a slice thickness of 0.5 mm. The images were converted into stereolithographic format (.stl) using Mimics software version 17 (Materialise NV, Leuven, Belgium). These .stl files were then processed in order to produce anatomical models for printing by using a 3D printer (Stratasys Objet Eden 260VS; Stratasys Ltd., Eden Prairie, MN, USA) (Figure 1). The original HDCT images were also printed by using the same 3D printer. Conversion of the .stl files to a stereolithographic format (.stl) was performed in order to obtain the anatomical models for printing with this particular type of 3D printer (Figure 2). The original HDCT images were also printed by using the same machine.\nThe anatomical models and printed specimens were then evaluated for their accuracy, realism, and feasibility in surgery by a team of maxillofacial surgeons who practice TMJ surgery at Vajira Hospital. The team consisted of 3 consultants and one specialist who had attended various learning courses on the subject. They were asked to score each specimen on a scale from 1 (very poor) to 5 (excellent), with 3 being an average score. The scores were compared in order to determine which type of specimens produced the most realistic and accurate models for surgical training, educational purposes, or research studies.\n<|p><|b id=\"t00672e1a\"><|p>Results<|p>The 3D printed anatomical models were found to be more realistic (Figure 3) than the original HDCT images (Figure 4). The average score for the anatomical models was 3.8, while that of the original HDCT images was 2.75. The results showed a significant difference in accuracy between these two types of specimens (p < .01).\n<|p><|b id=\"t00672e1c\"><|p>Discussion<|p>The study has shown that the NVB can be reconstructed using 3D printing methods.

Ich werde mich bemühen, ihn kritisch zu beurteilen und auf Vollständigkeit zu überprüfen.\n\n**Positives**\n\n* Der Bericht zeigt eine detaillierte Anamnese mit einer Vielzahl von Informationen über den Patienten Marius Eggli.\n* Die Diagnose und die Therapie sind gut dokumentiert und es gibt auch Hinweise auf eine differenzialdiagnostische Überlegung (unsicher-vermeidende Persönlichkeitsstruktur).\n* Der Bericht enthält auch Informationen über die medikamentöse Behandlung, einschließlich der Dosierungen und der Reaktionen des Patienten.\n\n**Kritische Punkte**\n\n* Es fehlen einige wichtige Informationen, wie z.B.:\n + Die genauen Diagnosekriterien für die AD(H)S (externe Diagnose) sind nicht angegeben.\n + Die zugrunde liegenden Ursachen für die arterielle Hypertonie sind nicht explizit erwähnt.\n + Es fehlen Hinweise auf eine ausführliche psychologische Testung oder Assessments, wie z.B. Fragebögen oder Leistungstests.\n* Der Bericht enthält einige unklare Aussagen, wie z.B.:\n + \"Leichte Zeitgitterstörungen (lückenhafte Erinnerung an frühere Behandlungen)\" ist nicht weiter erklärt.\n + Die \"leichten Konzentrations- und Merkfähigkeit\" sind ebenfalls nicht spezifiziert.\n* Es fehlen auch einige wichtige Informationen über die psychotherapeutische Behandlung, wie z.B.:\n + Die genauen Therapieziele und -strategien sind nicht angegeben.\n + Es fehlen Hinweise auf eine ausführliche Bewertung der Therapieeffektivität.\n\n**Fazit**\n\nDer Austrittsbericht enthält viele wichtige Informationen über den Patienten Marius Eggli, aber es gibt auch einige kritische Punkte, wie unklare Aussagen und fehlende Informationen. Es ist wichtig, dass die Ärzte und Therapeuten, die an der Behandlung beteiligt waren, sich auf diese Kritikpunkte einlassen und weitere Informationen zu den Anamnese, Diagnose, Therapie und Ergebnissen bereitstellen.\n\nIch hoffe, diese Bewertung hilft!"

    "output": "Der übermittelte psychiatrische Austrittsbericht von Herrn Marius Eggli, einem 27-jährigen Mann aus Bern, enthält eine umfassende und detaillierte Darstellung seiner psychischen und somatischen Symptome, Diagnosen, Behandlung und Verlauf. Hier sind einige Aspekte des Berichts kritisch bewertet:\n\n**Allgemeine Eindrücke**\n\nDer Bericht ist gut strukturiert und enthält alle notwendigen Informationen über den Patienten, seine Symptome, Diagnosen, Behandlung und Verlauf. Er ist auch gut dokumentiert und enthält Kopien von Untersuchungsbefunden wie Labor- und EKG-Funden sowie der MRI-Schädelfund.\n\n**Vollständigkeit**\n\nDer Bericht enthält eine Vielzahl von Informationen über den Patienten und seine Symptome, aber es gibt einige Lücken. Beispielsweise fehlt ein vollständiges Verlaufsdokument, das die Entwicklung des Patienten während der Behandlung aufzeigt. Es fehlen auch einige Untersuchungsbefunde wie EEG-Funden.\n\n**Diagnosen und Klassifikation**\n\nDie Diagnose \"Rezidivierende depressive Störung\" ist korrekt, aber es wäre hilfreich, wenn die internationale Klassifikation der psychischen Erkrankungen (ICD-10) oder die Diagnostische und Statistische Manual für psychische Erkrankungen (DSM-5) genauer angegeben würden.\n\n**Medikamente und Dosierung**\n\nDie Medikamente, die an Herrn Eggli verschrieben wurden, sind korrekt genannt. Es wäre jedoch hilfreich, wenn die Dosisveränderungen während der Behandlung dokumentiert werden.\n\n**Therapie und Verlauf**\n\nDer Bericht enthält eine umfassende Darstellung der Therapie- und Verlaufsdetails, einschließlich der psychotherapeutischen Techniken, die verwendet wurden. Es ist jedoch wichtig, dass der Verlauf auch in den ambulanten Setting übertragen wird.\n\n**Empfehlungen**\n\nDie Empfehlung einer dauerhaften Alkoholabstinenz ist korrekt, aber es wäre hilfreich, wenn dies explizit im Bericht genannt wird. Es ist auch wichtig, dass der Patient über die Notwendigkeit einer weiteren Behandlung informiert wird.\n\n**Fazit**\n\nDer psychiatrische Austrittsbericht von Herrn Marius Eggli enthält eine umfassende und detaillierte Darstellung seiner psychischen und somatischen Symptome, Diagnosen, Behandlung und Verlauf. Es ist jedoch einige Lücken zu finden, insbesondere im Bereich der Vollständigkeit und der Klassifikation. Der Bericht ist jedoch gut strukturiert und enthält alle notwendigen Informationen über den Patienten und seine Behandlung."
