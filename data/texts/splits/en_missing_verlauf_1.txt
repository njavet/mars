<Therapy and Course>
<On Diagnostic Classification>
Based on depressed affect, reduced drive and anhedonia, self-deprecation, guilt, sleep disturbances, pessimistic outlook, and biographical indications of earlier depressive episodes, we diagnosed a severe recurrent depressive episode. Differential diagnosis considered an anxious-avoidant personality structure, though no personality disorder was diagnosed due to the currently pronounced affective symptomatology. No indication of specific organic etiology, especially given the unremarkable MRI.

<On Integrated Therapy Program>
During inpatient treatment, Mr. Eggli participated in our multimodal treatment program, which included medical-pharmacological treatment, individual and group psychotherapy, and primary nursing care.

<On Psychopharmacology>
Pharmacologically, we chose to initiate venlafaxine at a low starting dose of 37.5 mg per day and titrated up to a target dose of 75 mg per day. During the titration phase, typical but tolerable side effects occurred, including mild nausea, headache, dizziness, and increased sweating. These resolved completely in the course of treatment. Serial ECG and lab monitoring remained unremarkable.

<On Psychotherapeutic Topics>
Following diagnostic clarification, it was found that Mr. Eggli often had negative thoughts about his occupational performance, which led to feelings of worthlessness. In therapy, he learned to identify and challenge these thoughts. One coping strategy developed involved collecting concrete evidence of his abilities by documenting past successes or reflecting on positive feedback from colleagues or supervisors.
Cognitive restructuring techniques were then applied in individual and group sessions to change his thought patterns and improve self-esteem. Additionally, relaxation exercises and stress management techniques were introduced to help him better cope with professional challenges and increase his well-being.

<On Social Situation>
Following completion of treatment, the patient returned to his rental apartment and resumed his existing employment.

<On Course>
Condition improved over the course of treatment. [Note: original text ends with "Es verbesserte sich XXX."]
