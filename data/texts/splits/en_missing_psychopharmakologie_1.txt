<Therapy and Course>
<On Diagnostic Classification>
Based on depressed affect, lack of drive and anhedonia, self-devaluation, guilt, sleep disturbances, pessimistic outlook on the future, and biographical indicators of prior depressive episodes, we diagnosed a severe recurrent depressive episode. Differential diagnosis considered an anxious-avoidant personality structure, but no personality disorder was diagnosed due to the currently prominent affective symptoms. No indications for a specific organic etiology, especially with normal MRI findings.

<On Integrated Therapy Program>
During the inpatient stay, Mr. Eggli participated in our multimodal treatment program, which included medical-pharmacological treatment, individual and group psychotherapy, and primary nursing care.

<On Psychopharmacology>
Pharmacological decision pending / not documented in this version.

<On Psychotherapeutic Topics>
Following diagnostic clarification, it was evident that Mr. Eggli often harbored negative thoughts about his occupational performance, leading to feelings of worthlessness. In therapy, he learned to identify and question these thoughts. A developed coping strategy involved collecting concrete evidence of his competencies by recording past achievements or reflecting on positive feedback from colleagues or supervisors.
Cognitive restructuring techniques were applied in individual and group therapy sessions to help change these thought patterns and enhance self-esteem. Additionally, relaxation exercises and stress management techniques were conveyed to help him better handle occupational challenges and improve his well-being.

<On Social Situation>
Upon completion of treatment, the patient returned to his rental apartment and resumed his existing employment.

<On Clinical Course>
Over the course of treatment, rumination, lack of drive, anhedonia, and future perspective improved. At discharge, the depressive syndrome was largely in remission without indications of acute suicidality.
We discharged Mr. Eggli in stable mental condition and, in the absence of any indications of acute self- or other-endangerment, back into his established living and work situation.
