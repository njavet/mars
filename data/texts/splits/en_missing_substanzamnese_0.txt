<Admission Circumstances>
Presented to the Insel psychiatric emergency service on referral from Dr. Zwanghaft,
accompanied by his wife on a voluntary basis.
Transferred from there by taxi to UPD Bolligenstrasse.

<Summary of History>
Mr. Eggli reported experiencing stress at work upon admission. He has felt overwhelmed since the summer, has had to work many extra hours, and felt like he had hardly any free time. He has not felt joy for months, possibly years, and is just surviving. Recently, he has had to force himself to go to work as he no longer had the motivation.
To self-medicate and remain active, he increasingly consumed stimulants (approximately 60 mg of methylphenidate orally per day).
Initially, he was prescribed these by the Concentration Center two years ago, but now he obtains the medication illicitly on the street.
He took a vacation and was glad to finally have time for himself. He would have preferred to stay at home and rest but noticed that he was deteriorating and needed help. Regarding his current condition, he suffers most from fatigue, lack of drive, and persistently low mood. He hopes things will improve soon.

<Previous Psychiatric History>
Single outpatient consultation with psychiatrist Dr. Hysterion five years ago (ca. 2019) due to relationship conflicts.
Two years ago (2021), ADHD was diagnosed at the Concentration Center, and he was treated with various medications for ADHD and depression (Concerta, Wellbutrin), most recently with methylphenidate at 20 mg daily.
Since January 2023, outpatient psychotherapy with Dr. phil. Daphne HÃ¶rgutzu. No previous psychiatric hospitalizations.

<Somatic History>
Arterial hypertension since 2021, treated with Lisinopril 5 mg.
Assessment at Meer Hospital due to porphyria.
