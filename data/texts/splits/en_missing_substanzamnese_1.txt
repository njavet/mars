<Therapy and Course>
<On Diagnostic Classification>
Based on depressed affect, reduced drive and anhedonia, self-devaluation, guilt, sleep disturbances, pessimistic outlook on the future, and biographical indications of earlier depressive episodes, we diagnosed a severe recurrent depressive episode.
As differential diagnosis, an anxious-avoidant personality structure was considered, although we did not diagnose a personality disorder due to the currently pronounced affective symptoms. No indication of a specific organic cause, particularly with a normal MRI.

<On Integrated Therapy Program>
During inpatient treatment, Mr. Eggli participated in our multimodal treatment program, which included medical-pharmacological treatment, individual and group psychotherapy, and primary nursing care.

<On Psychopharmacology>
Pharmacologically, we chose to initiate venlafaxine at a low starting dose of 37.5 mg per day and titrated up to the target dose of 75 mg per day. During titration, typical but tolerable side effects occurred, including mild nausea, headaches, dizziness, and increased sweating. These subsided completely over the course of treatment. Follow-up ECG and laboratory controls were consistently unremarkable.

<On Psychotherapeutic Topics>
Following diagnostic clarification, it was found that Mr. Eggli frequently had negative thoughts regarding his professional performance, leading to feelings of worthlessness. In therapy, he learned to identify and challenge these thoughts. A developed coping strategy included collecting concrete evidence of his capabilities by documenting past successes or reflecting on positive feedback from colleagues or supervisors.
Cognitive restructuring techniques were applied in individual and group therapy sessions to alter his thought patterns and strengthen his self-esteem. Additionally, relaxation exercises and stress management techniques were taught to help him better manage work-related challenges and improve his overall well-being.

<On Social Situation>
Upon completion of treatment, the patient returned to his rented apartment and existing employment.

<On Course>
During the course of treatment, ruminative thoughts, reduced drive, anhedonia, and his future outlook improved. At discharge, he presented with a largely remitted depressive syndrome and no signs of acute suicidality.
We discharge Mr. Eggli in a stable mental condition, with no indications of acute self- or external endangerment, back into his established living and work environment.
