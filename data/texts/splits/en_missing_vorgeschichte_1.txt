<Therapy and Course>
<On Diagnostic Classification>
Based on depressive affect, reduced drive and anhedonia, as well as self-deprecation, guilt, sleep disturbances, pessimistic future outlook, and biographical evidence of previous depressive episodes, we diagnosed a severe recurrent depressive episode. As differential diagnosis, an anxious-avoidant personality structure was considered; however, no personality disorder was diagnosed due to the currently pronounced affective symptoms. No indications of a specific organic origin were found, particularly with normal MRI.

<On Integrated Therapy Program>
During inpatient treatment, Mr. Eggli participated in our multimodal treatment program, which included medical-pharmacological treatment, individual and group psychotherapy, and primary nursing care.

<On Psychopharmacology>
Pharmacologically, we chose to initiate venlafaxine at a low starting dose of 37.5 mg per day and titrated up to a target dose of 75 mg per day. Typical but tolerable side effects occurred during titration, including mild nausea, headaches, dizziness, and increased sweating. These subsided completely during the course. Serial ECGs and lab monitoring were unremarkable.

<On Psychotherapeutic Topics>
Following diagnostic clarification, it became evident that Mr. Eggli frequently harbored negative thoughts about his professional performance, which led to feelings of worthlessness. In therapy, he learned to identify and challenge these thoughts. A developed coping strategy involved collecting concrete evidence of his abilities by recording past successes or reflecting on positive feedback from colleagues or supervisors. Cognitive restructuring techniques were then applied in individual and group therapy sessions to change his thought patterns and enhance his self-esteem. Additionally, relaxation exercises and stress management techniques were conveyed to help him better handle professional challenges and increase his well-being.

<On Social Situation>
After completion of treatment, the patient returned to his rented apartment and resumed his existing employment.

<On Course>
Over the course of treatment, rumination, reduced drive, anhedonia, and future perspective improved. At discharge, a largely remitted depressive syndrome was present without indications of acute suicidality. Mr. Eggli was discharged in stable mental condition and, in the absence of any indications of acute danger to self or others, returned to his established living and working circumstances.
