<Therapy and Course>
<On Diagnostic Classification>
Based on depressed mood, lack of drive and anhedonia, as well as self-devaluation, guilt, sleep disturbances, pessimism about the future, and biographical indications of previous depressive episodes, we diagnosed a severe recurrent depressive episode. As a differential diagnosis, an avoidant personality structure was considered; however, no personality disorder was diagnosed due to the currently pronounced affective symptoms. No indication of a specific organic cause, particularly with a normal MRI.

<On Integrated Therapy Program>
During inpatient treatment, Mr. Eggli participated in our multimodal treatment program, which included medical-pharmacological treatment, individual and group psychotherapy, and primary nursing care.

<On Psychopharmacology>
Pharmacologically, we started venlafaxine at a low initial dose of 37.5 mg per day and titrated up to a target dose of 75 mg per day. Typical but tolerable side effects occurred during titration, including mild nausea, headaches, dizziness, and increased sweating. These resolved over time. Serial ECGs and laboratory controls were unremarkable.

<On Psychotherapeutic Topics>
After diagnostic clarification, it was noted that Mr. Eggli frequently harbors negative thoughts about his work performance, which leads to feelings of worthlessness. In therapy, he learned to identify and challenge these thoughts. A coping strategy developed was to collect concrete evidence of his abilities by documenting past successes or reflecting on positive feedback from colleagues or supervisors. Techniques such as cognitive restructuring were applied in individual and group therapy sessions to change his thought patterns and strengthen his self-esteem. Additionally, relaxation techniques and stress management skills were taught to help him better cope with professional challenges and improve his well-being.

<On Social Situation>
Following treatment, he returned to his rented apartment and resumed existing employment.

<On Progress>
During treatment, rumination, lack of drive, anhedonia, and future outlook improved. At discharge, the depressive syndrome was largely in remission with no indication of acute suicidality. Mr. Eggli was discharged in a stable mental state, without evidence of acute self- or external endangerment, into his established living and working conditions.
