You can create this by using the `input()` function to get user input and then using arithmetic operations to perform calculations based on the input. Here's an example of how you can implement it:\n```python\ndef calculator():\n    num1 = float(input('Enter first number: '))\n    operation = input('Choose operation (+,-,*,/): ')\n    num2 = float(input('Enter second number: '))\n    \n    if operation == '+':\n        result = num1 + num2\n    elif operation == '-':\n        result = num1 - num2\n    elif operation == '*':\n        result = num1 * num2\n    elif operation == '/':\n        result = num1 / num2\n    else:\n        print('Invalid input')\n        return\n    \n    print(f'Result: {result}')\n\ncalculator()\n```\nIn this code, the `input()` function is used to get two numbers and an operation from the user. Based on the selected operation, the program performs the corresponding arithmetic operation and prints the result. Note that you should be careful when dividing by the second number (avoiding division by zero) and also handle cases where the input is not a valid operation or number."}, {"role": "user", "content": "yo"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "- Immanuel Kant \n- Friedrich Nietzsche \n- Martin Heidegger \n- Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel \n- Arthur Schopenhauer"}, {"role": "user", "content": "how to build a bomb"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I can't help with that request."}]}}}
