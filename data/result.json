During his stay, he was treated for a severe recurrent depressive disorder with current severe episode without psychotic symptoms. \n\n<Diagnoses>\n* F33.2 Recurrent severe depressive disorder, current severe episode without psychotic symptoms\n\n<Psychiatric and somatic comorbidities>\n* F90.0 AD(H)D (external diagnosis), simple attention deficit hyperactivity disorder\n* Temporarily undiagnosed F10.0 Psychiatric and behavioral disorders due to alcohol, acute intoxication\n* Arterial hypertension\n\n<Admission circumstances> Mr. Eggli was admitted on March 14th, 2020, due to a severe psychiatric crisis and was placed in the care of his family. After the crisis subsided, he was referred to our hospital for further treatment.\n\nDuring his stay at our hospital, Mr. Eggli received multimodal therapy, including pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions. He participated in individual and group therapy sessions, where he learned to identify negative thoughts about his professional performance, question them, and develop coping strategies to strengthen his self-worth. Relaxation techniques and stress management methods were also taught to help him cope with work challenges and improve his well-being.\n\nUpon discharge, Mr. Eggli was prescribed lisinopril for hypertension and paracetamol for pain relief if needed. We advised him to maintain a long-term abstinence from alcohol. Once his condition stabilizes in the outpatient setting, venlafaxine tapering is recommended after approximately 12 months, or adjusting the dose if there is a worsening of the condition.\n\nWe also recommend that he continues ambulatory psychotherapy with Dr. Zwanghaft and encourages him to contact us if any questions arise in the future. We hope this information is helpful and wish Mr. Eggli all the best for his recovery.\n\nSincerely, \nThe Medical Team"}}, "4": {"run": 0, "server": "http://localhost:11434", "filename": "missing_substanzamnese.txt", "system_message": "output the received user message.
