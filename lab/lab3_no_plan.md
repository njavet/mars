Plan: <think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how to use these two functions to calculate 42 + 23 + 56 + 33. Let me think about this step by step.

First, there's this function called put_on_stack which takes an integer and adds it to the top of the stack. So if I call put_on_stack(42), then put_on_stack(23), and so on for each number, those numbers will be added one after another onto the stack.

Then there's sum_stack, which calculates the sum of all values in the stack and then empties the stack. But here's the thing: when I call sum_stack(), it returns the sum immediately or does it wait until I actually need it? From the description, it says it calculates and returns the sum, and after that, it empties the stack.

So my plan is to push each of these numbers onto the stack one by one. Then, once all are pushed, call sum_stack() which will add them up and clear the stack. That way, I get the total sum without having to manage anything else.

Let me outline this:

1. Push 42 onto the stack.
2. Push 23 onto the stack.
3. Push 56 onto the stack.
4. Push 33 onto the stack.
5. Call sum_stack() which will add all these together and return the result, then clear the stack.

This should give me the correct total of 154 without any leftover numbers in the stack after I'm done.

I think that's it. It seems straightforward since each number is added before the sum is calculated. There's no risk of losing any data or having intermediate sums because we're only using these two functions.

To calculate the sum of 42 + 23 + 56 + 33 using the provided stack operations, follow these steps:

1. **Push each number onto the stack:**
   - Use `put_on_stack(42)`
   - Followed by `put_on_stack(23)`
   - Then `put_on_stack(56)`
   - Finally, `put_on_stack(33)`

2. **Calculate the sum of all numbers in the stack:**
   - Call `sum_stack()`
   
This process ensures that each number is added to the stack and then summed together when called, resulting in the correct total of 154 while clearing the stack after use.

Alright, so I need to figure out how to use the given functions to solve 42 + 23 + 56 + 33. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that there are two functions: put_on_stack and sum_stack. The goal is to get the total of these four numbers using these functions.

I think the approach should involve pushing each number onto the stack one by one. That makes sense because the stack data structure holds multiple values temporarily, which we can then process together.

So, step 1 would be to push 42 onto the stack. Now, when I call sum_stack after this, it will return just 42 and empty the stack. But wait, that's not helpful yet because I need all four numbers summed up. So maybe I should push each number individually without immediately summing them.

Wait, but if I push each number one by one, each time calling sum_stack would give me only the last number pushed. That wouldn't help accumulate the total. Hmm, this is a problem.

Let me think again. Maybe I need to first sum all numbers and then somehow retrieve that sum from the stack after processing all of them. But how? The functions don't allow direct access to individual elements except for pushing and popping implicitly when summing.

Wait, maybe I can push each number onto the stack in sequence and then call sum_stack once at the end. That way, it will add up all four numbers together before emptying the stack. Let me see if that works.

So, step by step:

1. Push 42.
   - Stack: [42]
   
2. Push 23.
   - Stack: [42, 23]
   
3. Push 56.
   - Stack: [42, 23, 56]
   
4. Push 33.
   - Stack: [42, 23, 56, 33]

Now, when I call sum_stack(), it should calculate the total of all these numbers combined.

But how does that work with the function? Since after each push, if I immediately call sum_stack, it would only give me the last number. So to get the correct total, I need to make sure that sum_stack is called once after all pushes are done.

Wait, but in reality, when you have a stack and use sum_stack, it probably iterates through all elements before summing them up and then empties the stack. So if I push each number one by one, and then call sum_stack at the end, it should add them all together correctly.

Let me test this logic:

After pushing 42, 23, 56, 33 in order:
- Stack has [42, 23, 56, 33]

sum_stack() calculates 42 + 23 = 65, then adds 56 to get 121, and finally adds 33 to reach 154. Then the stack is emptied.

So yes, that should work. Therefore, I just need to push each number in sequence and call sum_stack once at the end.

To calculate the total of 42 + 23 + 56 + 33 using the given functions, follow these steps:

1. **Push each number onto the stack:**
   - Use `put_on_stack(42)`
   - Use `put_on_stack(23)`
   - Use `put_on_stack(56)`
   - Use `put_on_stack(33)`

2. **Calculate and retrieve the sum of all numbers in the stack:**
   - Call `sum_stack()`, which will return 154 (the total of 42 + 23 + 56 + 33).
   - Note that after calling `sum_stack()`, the stack will be emptied.

**Answer:** The sum is \boxed{154}.
