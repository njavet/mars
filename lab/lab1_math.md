First, I'll add the two numbers: 2 and 64. This gives me a total of 66.

Next, I need to divide this sum by 3. Dividing 66 by 3 results in 22.

Then, I will take that result and divide it by 2. Dividing 22 by 2 yields 11.

Therefore, the final answer is 11.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Add the two numbers:**
   
   \( 2 + 64 = 66 \)

2. **Divide the result by 3:**
   
   \( \frac{66}{3} = 22 \)

3. **Divide that result by 2:**
   
   \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \)

**Final Answer:**  
\(\boxed{11}\)


LLAMA To solve this problem, let's follow the order of operations:

1. Add 2 and 64: 2 + 64 = 66
2. Divide the result by 3: 66 รท 3 = 22
3. Divide the result by 2: 22 รท 2 = 11

Therefore, the correct answer is:

* 11
