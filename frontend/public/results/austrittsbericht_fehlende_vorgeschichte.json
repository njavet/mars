The use of drugs in patients with renal insufficiency presents several problems that are not commonly encountered by the internist treating patients who have normal renal function. 1 These include selection and dosage of appropriate medications, determination of the optimal therapeutic regimen to employ, and monitoring drug therapy for potential adverse effects in this population. In addition, certain drugs are contraindicated or require particular precautions in patients with renal insufficiency.  \nDrug therapy for most diseases that are commonly encountered by the internist is frequently safe in patients with impaired renal function; however, special considerations must be given to several categories of drugs when they are prescribed or administered to such patients. 2 The first category includes those agents whose therapeutic use requires close monitoring of clinical and laboratory indices to prevent undesirable drug side effects. Examples of this type include aminoglycosides, acyclovir, azathioprine, methotrexate, procainamide and diuretics such as furosemide.  \nThe second category includes those drugs whose use is contraindicated or restricted in patients with impaired renal function because of potential toxicities. 2 These include many drugs that are used for the treatment of a variety of diseases, including acetazolamide, aminophylline, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, antihistaminic drugs such as promethazine, antibiotics such as penicillins and cephalosporins, the cardiac glycosides (digoxin), corticosteroids (such as prednisolone) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents.  \nThe third category of drugs includes those that are cleared by the kidney, for example, digoxin, procainamide, methotrexate and cephalosporins, 2 but whose use can be safe if specific clinical guidelines are followed; namely, doses should be adjusted appropriately to maintain drug levels within acceptable limits. 3-7  \nThe fourth category includes drugs that may require special consideration for patients with renal insufficiency because of their relatively low or high therapeutic index (TI), the ratio between the lethal dose and the effective dose. An example is the antibiotic amoxicillin, which has a TI of 15, implying that for every 100 patients with normal renal function receiving therapeutic doses of this drug, one patient will die or be seriously harmed as a result of therapy. However, an agent such as salicylic acid, whose lethal dose is only six times greater than its effective dose has a TI of 50. Thus, for every 100 patients with normal renal function receiving therapeutic doses of this drug, one patient will die or be seriously harmed as a result of therapy. 8  \nThe fifth category includes drugs whose use is not contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency but where adjustments in the dosage regimen are required to maintain therapeutic drug levels within acceptable limits. An example is methotrexate, which when used for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis or psoriasis must be given at reduced dosages (up to 10% of the usual dose) in patients with impaired renal function. In addition, monitoring of drug levels is essential because toxic effects occur if the serum level of methotrexate exceeds 30 pg/ml. This occurs more frequently when high dosages are given. Another example is digoxin, whose use in patients with impaired renal function requires special attention to dosage adjustments and monitoring of drug levels because toxicities occur at higher serum concentrations than for patients without renal insufficiency. 9  \nThe sixth category includes drugs that are usually cleared by the kidney but may be dialyzable, for example, methotrexate, aminophylline, procainamide and cephalosporins. Drug clearance during dialysis is influenced by several factors including urea clearance, drug protein binding, membrane permeability of the agent to be cleared (either the patient or the dialyzer), and the efficiency of the blood compartment for that drug in relation to the amount of drug present. 10 Aminophylline is an example of a drug whose clearance by hemodialysis is affected by the membrane permeability of both the patient and the hemodialyzer, whereas procainamide undergoes substantial removal during hemodialysis because of its protein binding in addition to its relatively high urea clearance.  \nIt should be emphasized that all agents described above can be used safely with appropriate dosage adjustments and monitoring of drug levels (except for aminophylline, procainamide and cephalosporins) when prescribed by physicians who are knowledgeable about the pharmacology and toxicities associated with these drugs.  \nIn contrast to this category of agents whose use in patients with renal insufficiency is usually safe as long as certain guidelines are followed, several groups of drugs should be used only with caution because their therapeutic index is relatively poor (i.e., they have a low TI). Aminoglycosides and cephalosporins are examples of this group of agents. 11 In addition, many of the newer antihypertensive drugs such as beta adrenergic blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers have a relatively low TI (see Appendix).  \nIn summary, it is not unusual for internists to prescribe agents that are either cleared by the kidney or whose use requires monitoring of drug levels because of their potential toxicity. It should be emphasized that all drugs can be used safely with appropriate dosage adjustments and monitoring of drug levels when prescribed by physicians who are knowledgeable about the pharmacology, therapeutic uses and toxicities associated with these drugs.  \nThe objectives of this report are to 1) provide an overview on the use of drugs in patients with renal insufficiency; and 2) review selected examples of agents that may pose a particular risk to patients with impaired renal function due to their potential toxicity, clearance by dialysis, or poor therapeutic index.  \n  \n## Drug use in the patient with renal insufficiency  \nThe choice of drug therapy for any given disease process should be based on its efficacy (clinical outcome) and safety (toxicity), both of which are affected by dose, duration of administration, route of administration, and the presence or absence of certain diseases or conditions. These factors may vary considerably in patients with renal insufficiency; consequently, drugs that have been used safely in patients with normal renal function may not be appropriate for use in patients with impaired renal function (see . For example, 1) a patient whose creatinine clearance is 50 ml/min given the drug dose recommended by the manufacturer will receive an excessive amount of the drug and be at high risk for toxicity; 2) when a drug's elimination half-life changes in patients with renal insufficiency, it may remain too long or too short after dialysis (see ; 3) certain drugs are cleared by hemodialysis and their administration immediately after dialysis may result in excessive toxicity due to the drug's rapid reappearance in the body; and 4) certain drugs should be administered in a relatively higher dose to achieve therapeutic concentrations (see .  \nThe choice of drug therapy should also take into consideration that patients with renal insufficiency are often elderly and have other diseases or conditions such as congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and arthritis. For this reason it is important to be aware that many drugs used to treat these diseases may affect the function of the kidney and can cause significant toxicity if administered in a high enough dose or for an excessive amount of time (see .  \nIt should also be noted that patients with renal insufficiency often have several concomitant medical conditions such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism. Consequently, when choosing drug therapy for these patients it is important to be aware that a particular drug may have more than one therapeutic action (see   \n  \n## . for example, diuretics are used frequently to treat hypertension in patients with renal insufficiency and also to relieve congestive heart failure in patients with coronary artery disease. consequently, the use of a potent diuretic such as furosemide may result in an excessive loss of sodium chloride (and fluid) resulting in a significant fall in blood pressure but also leading to hypotension and dehydration-both of which can be dangerous.  \nThe choice of drug therapy for any given disease process should also take into consideration that certain drugs are cleared by hemodialysis (see   \n  \n## . for example, a patient with renal insufficiency who has a normal blood level of an antihypertensive drug is at risk for hypertension during and immediately after dialysis because the drug's concentration is rapidly reduced to low levels. consequently, the usual dose of the drug should be given before starting hemodialysis in order to maintain therapeutic drug concentrations throughout the procedure and immediately after completion of  \ndialysis to avoid significant hypotension. However, it must also be noted that drugs such as procainamide are not cleared by hemodialysis and may accumulate at toxic levels if administered before dialysis. Consequently, a patient with renal insufficiency who has been receiving this drug should have the drug's administration suspended prior to dialysis and therapy should be initiated again after completion of the procedure.  \nIn addition, it is important to realize that drugs are cleared by hemodialysis in a predictable manner (see . For example, most agents administered intravenously during hemodialysis have half-lives of 60 min or less and their concentrations in plasma decline by about 50% per hour. Consequently, if a drug with a half-life of 2 h is given to a patient during dialysis therapy it will be eliminated at its predialysis level during the first hour of hemodialysis; thereafter, an additional 30% of the initial dose (or 6% of the usual dose) should be administered intravenously immediately after the completion of dialysis therapy.  \nFurthermore, drugs are often cleared by peritoneal dialysis at a rate similar to that observed during hemodialysis. Consequently, if a drug with a half-life of 2 h is given to a patient receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis therapy, it will be eliminated at its predialysis level during the first hour of treatment; thereafter an additional 30% of the initial dose (or 6% of the usual dose) should be administered intravenously immediately after completion of the procedure.  \n  \n## Drug elimination half-life in plasma vs hemodialysis clearance half-life  \nHalf-Life (hr) Hemodialysis Clearance (ml/min) 24 750 12 3500 6 18,000 4 7500 2 3750 1.5 1875  \n  \n## Clinical outcomes of drug therapy in renal insufficiency: efficacy and toxicity  \nThe choice of drug therapy for any given disease process should be based on its efficacy (clinical outcome) and safety (toxicity). For example, it is often desirable to achieve a particular blood pressure level with a minimal number of medications. If the patient's renal function is normal it may be possible to use a diuretic to lower the blood pressure sufficiently; however, if the renal function is impaired or absent, it may not be possible to attain the desired blood pressure level without also administering drugs that can damage the kidneys (see .  \nIt should also be noted that many drugs are ineffective at therapeutic levels in patients with renal insufficiency. For example, the drug phenytoin is an effective antiepileptic agent in patients with normal renal function; however, in patients whose renal function is impaired it can accumulate to dangerous levels resulting in significant neurologic and cardiac toxicity (see .  \nIn summary, when choosing drug therapy for a patient with renal insufficiency one must be aware of the fact that certain drugs are cleared by hemodialysis at a predictable rate. Consequently, it is important to administer these drugs either immediately before or after initiation of dialysis therapy (see   \n  \n## . furthermore, if a drug with an elimination half-life greater than 2 h is used in patients with renal insufficiency, then one must realize that its concentration will not fall to safe levels during hemodialysis and that significant toxicity may occur after dialysis therapy. however, when a drug's elimination halflife is less than or equal to 2 h and it is used in patients with renal insufficiency, then the concentration of the drug will be reduced during hemodialysis and there should not be any significant toxicity after dialysis therapy.  \nThe choice of drug therapy for a patient with renal insufficiency also requires a knowledge of which drugs are cleared by peritoneal dialysis at a predictable rate (see . For example, if theophylline is used in patients receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, its concentration will be reduced during treatment; thereafter an additional 30% of the initial dose should be administered intravenously immediately after completion of the procedure. However, as a patient's renal function decreases, so does the clearance rate of theophylline by peritoneal dialysis, and it is therefore not appropriate to use the drug in patients whose creatinine clearance falls below 10 ml/min (see .  \nThe choice of drug therapy for a patient with renal insufficiency also requires a knowledge of which drugs cause significant organ damage when used in excessive amounts or for an extended period. This is important because certain drugs accumulate at dangerous levels and can cause significant toxicity when renal function is impaired (see . For example, aminoglycoside antibiotics such as gentamicin are effective against many bacteria but must be used with caution in patients whose creatinine clearance falls below 50 ml/min because they can accumulate to dangerous levels and cause significant neurologic and cardiac damage.  \nAdditionally, certain drugs can also accumulate at dangerous levels in patients who are receiving renal dialysis therapy (see . For example, if a patient with normal renal function receives phenobarbital for 4 weeks, then the patient will develop an adequate serum concentration of the drug; however, if the same patient is placed on hemodialysis and phenobarbital is administered in its usual daily dosage, the drug can accumulate to toxic levels. This also occurs with other drugs such as methotrexate, phenytoin, diazepam, procainamide, amitriptyline, diltiazem, and warfarin (see . The ability of hemodialysis to remove these drugs depends on the dialyzer membrane used.  \nFinally, when choosing drug therapy for patients with renal insufficiency, it is important to note that some drugs are ineffective at therapeutic levels in patients whose creatinine clearance falls below 30 ml/min and others may be more effective at low concentrations (see .  \n  \n## Examples of commonly
