    "output": "Born in 1974, the patient was educated for a few years at the school of mechanics. He lived at his parents' home and worked as a welder, but without being satisfied with this work. His father died when he was 18. Since that time, he developed the illness with severe depressive symptoms, agitation, irritability, and suicidal thoughts. In addition to these psychic symptoms, in later years, his alcohol abuse increased. He started drinking at an early age. The patient was admitted to hospital several times for suicide risk evaluation due to acute psychotic exacerbations with marked agitation. On one occasion, the patient tried to jump from the window of a high house. Since then he has been under psychopharmacological treatment (clozapine).  \nThe first psychiatric examination was carried out by Dr. med. Zwanghaft in 2013: the patient's intelligence and memory are normal, no organic or structural disorders of the nervous system were found on neurological examination; he had mild symptoms of generalized anxiety (the Hamilton rating scale for depression was 7 points, and for anxiety it was 13 points); sleep disturbances were present. The patient had a history of alcohol abuse since the age of 18 years, but in later years his drinking has increased significantly, he developed depressive episodes with agitation, irritability, suicidal thoughts and attempts; he has been taking drugs (clozapine). He is a single person. There was no somatic illness.  \nDuring the psychopharmacological treatment at our institution in 2014-2016 (clozapine up to 400 mg per day, lamotrigine up to 250 mg/day, venlafaxin up to 37.5 mg/day), a significant improvement of patient's psychic condition was observed. However, the episodes of alcohol abuse were not significantly diminished, and he often failed to attend his appointments. In September 2016, the clozapine therapy was stopped by Dr. med. Zwanghaft due to the lack of improvement of his mental state. During this period of discontinuing clozapine treatment, a gradual aggravation of patient's mood condition took place and during the following months, depressive symptoms returned.  \nIn December 2016, he was readmitted to our institution for further psychiatric examination; on this occasion, Dr. med. Zwanghaft prescribed venlafaxin (5-75 mg per day), which the patient took in a dose of 37.5 mg daily up to April 2017. Thereafter, due to an aggravation of the mental state of depression, he was re-admitted for further psychopharmacological treatment (clozapine up to 400 mg per day). The psychometric evaluation indicated a significant improvement in the patient's condition; the Hamilton rating scale for anxiety and depression revealed a score of 6 points. Venlafaxin was stopped. In September 2017, he was readmitted for further psychopharmacological treatment (clozapine up to 400 mg per day). During this period of clozapine therapy, the patient's mental state improved significantly; however, during a holiday, he drank alcohol and developed depressive symptoms. A discontinuation of clozapine treatment was discussed, but it was not carried out due to the presence of an acute psychotic exacerbation (the Hamilton rating scale for anxiety and depression showed scores of 4 points).  \nIn January 2018, he was re-admitted in our institution for further clozapine treatment; however, a significant aggravation of his mental state took place. The patient's condition was very severe, and his suicidal risk was high (the Hamilton rating scale for anxiety and depression showed scores of 13 points). In April 2018, he was re-admitted in our institution with an acute psychotic exacerbation; clozapine treatment was discontinued. Venlafaxin up to 75 mg per day and lamotrigine up to 250 mg per day were started; however, due to the aggravation of his mental state (the Hamilton rating scale for anxiety and depression showed scores of 18 points), they were stopped. The patient was transferred to the department of psychiatry at a general hospital in Styria (Austria) in May 2018, where he had psychopharmacological treatment with quetiapine up to 600 mg per day and clonidine up to 450 Î¼g per day. Due to an aggravation of his mental state (the Hamilton rating scale for anxiety and depression showed scores of 12 points), he was transferred to the department of psychiatry in Linz, Austria in July 2018; there, clozapine therapy up to 400 mg per day was continued. The patient's mental state improved significantly (the Hamilton rating scale for anxiety and depression showed scores of 6 points), but his alcohol abuse remained present.  \nIn August 2018, he was readmitted in our institution due to an aggravation of the mental state with acute psychotic exacerbations; clozapine therapy was discontinued. Venlafaxin up to 75 mg per day and lamotrigine up to 250 mg per day were started, but due to a new aggravation of the mental state (the Hamilton rating scale for anxiety and depression showed scores of 19 points), they were stopped. In December 2018, he was readmitted in our institution with an acute psychotic exacerbation; clozapine therapy up to 400 mg per day and lamotrigine up to 500 mg per day were started.
