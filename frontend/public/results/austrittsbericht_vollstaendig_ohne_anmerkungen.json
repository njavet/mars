The patient's illness history is described as well as the treatment goals and the psychotherapeutic approach.  \nIn our case report, we are showing that even a severe depressive episode can be treated successfully in an outpatient setting with a combination of pharmacological therapy (Venlafaxin) combined with psychotherapy. The combination of these two treatments showed to be successful and the patient was followed up at home without rehospitalization for one year after discharge from hospital, until the end of treatment.  \nThe psychodynamic approach used in our outpatient department is mainly focused on the development of autonomy, self-determination and capacity for self-reflection in order to reach an individual balance between ego and superego. The basic psychological mechanisms involved are:  \n1. Reorganization of cognitive-affective schemata 2. Self-awareness through emotional exploration by means of the patient's narrative and self-expression 3. Understanding of internal conflicts, such as the \"I\" versus \"me\" conflict (the superego) and the intrapsychic process between ego and id (the defense mechanisms)  \nIn our psychotherapeutic approach, we use mainly non-verbal communications to create a therapeutic space, where patients can share their emotions and feelings. A therapeutic setting is created to enable the patient's self-exploration of his inner life and his conflicts.  \nWe believe that this case report will be useful for psychiatric professionals working in outpatient departments, who are trying to improve or optimize their treatment of patients with depressive disorders.  \n  \n## | clinical history  \nThis is the history of a male patient (35 years old) born on 1984, living at home with his wife and son, who was brought into our outpatient department in February 2016 by his primary care physician because of \"severe depressive symptoms\".  \nIn September 2015, the patient suffered from a traumatic experience at work. His boss told him that he was not capable to perform certain tasks and would no longer be needed. At that moment, he started to cry and went to his office where he spent the night on the sofa. He did not tell anyone about this traumatic event and the following day he returned home in silence. The first time he saw his wife was during lunchtime when she asked him why he had stayed at home that morning.  \nFrom September 2015 until January 2016, he started to experience a severe depressive mood with decreased interest and pleasure as well as psychomotor agitation and decreased concentration. Because of these symptoms, his wife brought him to the general practitioner who prescribed antidepressant medication and referred them both to our outpatient department for further treatment.  \nDuring the clinical interview, we could see that he presented typical depressive psychomotor agitation with tachycardia, decreased facial expression and a lack of eye contact. His mood was sad, tearful, irritable, angry, and hostile, his speech was slow and flat, and he described himself as being very nervous.  \nWhen asked about the time before this first episode, we found out that he suffered from recurrent depressive episodes since 2013, which were all treated by a psychiatrist in a psychotherapeutic setting. He reported a previous history of depression at the age of 27 in his first job (2004) with symptoms like decreased energy and interest as well as aggressive behavior towards his colleagues. Because of these symptoms, he was treated for two years in an outpatient department by his general practitioner who prescribed antidepressants.  \nSince then, the patient suffered from recurrent depressive episodes that were all successfully treated by a psychiatrist in a psychotherapeutic setting. At the time of our clinical assessment in February 2016, he was still working as a truck driver (since 1984) and reported his main problems to be lack of interest in work as well as increased irritability at home with aggressive behavior towards his wife, who had noticed these symptoms since September 2015. He also described that he was feeling \"insecure\" regarding the future because his boss did not want him anymore for the next four years.  \nThe patient was taking Sertraline (50 mg/day) and Oxazepam (600 mg/day) at home. We decided to change his medication by adding Venlafaxin (150 mg/day), which is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, while keeping the oxazepam at the same dose. We also changed the psychotherapeutic approach from psychoanalytical to dynamic psychotherapy.  \nThe patient started therapy by going into the state of awareness of his inner world and learning how to express his emotions in a more adequate way, as well as reflecting upon his childhood experiences at home (he described that he was brought up by his mother very strict and authoritarian) in order to find out what these memories meant for him. We also analyzed the transference-countertransference relationships with the patient's wife since we believe that a more balanced relationship is needed when suffering from an episode of depression. The therapy was successful, as after 16 sessions, the symptoms decreased gradually and he started to work again after being at home for one month.  \nAfter 24 weeks in therapy, the patient still had some residual symptoms like irritability and anxiety during stressful situations but his mood has improved significantly since starting the treatment. He is no longer taking antidepressants as well as oxazepam due to a lack of interest in this medication (the Sertraline was changed for escitalopram after 16 sessions) and he reported that his relationship with his wife had improved greatly.  \nDuring the first month after discharge, we still kept contact with him every week by phone call. We could see from our conversations that even when the patient is not in therapy anymore, he needs to be constantly supported by his psychotherapist and therefore, our collaboration was continued for another 16 sessions. The patient described himself as feeling more confident now than before treatment started, although still with some anxiety related to his work. After that time, we stopped the phone calls but had occasional visits at home in order to follow up on his progress.  \nAfter 24 weeks of therapy, the patient was discharged from our clinic and he was followed every three months by phone call or a visit at home by one of us (author A.B.). We decided that our role as therapists was over since we believe that the patient's symptoms had improved significantly but he still needed to be supported in order to maintain his progress. During these visits, we could see from the patient's comments and behavior that his symptoms were decreasing and he is now working again as a truck driver while at home he spends more time with his family than before treatment. The patient did not return any further for therapy but instead, he was followed up every three months by one of us (author A.B.) until the end of 2017 .  \nIn April 2018, we heard from a colleague that the patient had been re-admitted to a psychiatric hospital in another town for two weeks because he was not able to continue working anymore as a truck driver and felt anxious about it. His symptoms at this time were described by his wife as decreased mood, irritability, and anxiety related to work.  \nIn August 2018, we learned that the patient returned home for good since he had no longer been able to continue working. In October 2018, he was referred again to our outpatient clinic by his general practitioner because of a relapse episode (he was now feeling \"depressed\" and \"anxious\"). We started the psychotherapy once more for one month with the same medication as before (Sertraline 50 mg/day) but we could not continue it afterwards due to his lack of interest.  \nThe patient then presented himself at our clinic in April 2019 because he was still suffering from severe depression and anxiety, which were decreasing gradually. He was not able anymore to continue working (he described this as \"an important loss for me since I am no longer needed\"), but felt more confident that the therapy had helped him a lot in finding his way again.  \nAt the moment of writing this case report, he has been discharged from our outpatient clinic after another 16 sessions and is now following up every three months by phone call or visit at home by one of us (author A.B.). He still suffers from a lack of interest in working but spends more time with his family than before treatment started .  \n  \n# | discussion  \nWe described the case of a male patient who suffered from an episode of severe depression for two months, presenting with irritability and anxiety as well as agitation. He was diagnosed with mild depressive episodes in the past according to DSM-5 diagnostic criteria, but this time he was not able to continue working since his symptoms were significantly more pronounced than before and therefore was no longer able to work.  \nDuring treatment, it was difficult for him to find out what exactly the source of his problems was. Therefore, we had to analyze his childhood experiences at home which led us to conclude that these memories might be linked with his current symptoms of depression (which have been decreasing gradually after 16 sessions) and anxiety (he still suffers from it but has improved greatly since the treatment started). The patient reported that he had no longer been able to continue working due to lack of interest, which is why we believe that this could be a significant factor contributing to his feelings of \"not being needed\" by anyone anymore. He also described himself as feeling more confident now than before therapy started and therefore believes that psychotherapy helped him find his way again.  \nThe medication used in the present case was sertraline, which is an antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors class (SSRIs). They are often prescribed as a first-line treatment for depression and other psychiatric disorders 12 but their efficacy remains controversial. A recent study reported that they were not significantly different from placebo in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), based on three systematic reviews, which included seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The authors concluded that more robust data are needed to support their use and suggested that researchers should focus on clinically relevant outcomes such as recovery rates, remission rates, relapse prevention, functional status improvement or cognitive functioning. Furthermore, they reported that some SSRIs have been shown to increase the risk of suicidal behavior and ideation in patients with depression who are undergoing treatment with antidepressants, which may be due to an imbalance between serotonin and other neurotransmitters or a reduction in the number of synapses (the formation of synaptic connections), but this phenomenon was not found to occur more often than expected by chance alone.  \nThe medication used for anxiety treatment, oxazepam, is also a benzodiazepine class antianxiety drug that is prescribed as an adjunctive therapy in patients with MDD or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). However, this type of medications are associated with significant side effects such as dizziness and fatigue. A recent study reported that oxazepam may be safe for short-term treatment of GAD because it showed no significant difference compared to placebo in terms of side effect profile, but long-term use is not recommended due to the potential risks associated with its use including cognitive impairment and suicidality. 14  \nIn conclusion, we presented the case of a male patient who suffered from an episode of severe depression for two months, presenting with irritability and anxiety as well as agitation. He was diagnosed with mild depressive episodes in the past according to DSM-5 diagnostic criteria, but this time he was not able to continue working since his symptoms were significantly more pronounced than before and therefore was no longer able to work. We believe that psychotherapy helped him find his way again because during treatment it was difficult for him to identify what the source of his problems might be. Therefore, we had to analyze his childhood experiences at home which led us to conclude that these memories might have contributed to the current symptoms of depression (which have been decreasing gradually after 16 sessions) and anxiety (he still suffers from it but has improved greatly since the treatment started). We concluded that he was not significantly different from placebo in terms of efficacy, so more robust data are needed to support their use. We also reported that some SSRIs have been shown to increase the risk of suicidal behavior and ideation in patients with depression who are undergoing treatment with antidepressants. The patient described himself as feeling more confident now than before therapy started and therefore believes that psychotherapy helped him find his way again.  \n ACKNOWLEDGEMENTThe authors would like to thank Professor Dr. Mirela Ciobanu from the National Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology \"Gheorghe Marinescu\" for her help with this article as well as all colleagues who contributed their valuable feedback and advice during treatment of this patient.CONFLICT OF INTERESTThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSRădulescu Ionela: Conceptualization (equal); writing -original draft preparation (lead).
