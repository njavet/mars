Discharge Report
EGGLI Marius, 27.09.1980, Paradisstrasse 57, 3014 Bern\nDear Colleague,
We report on the above-mentioned patient already known to us,
who was in our inpatient care from 01.03.2024 to 29.03.2024 and
in our (partial) inpatient care from 30.04.2024 to 15.04.2024\non Ward Methusalem.
\n<Diagnoses>
* F33.2 Recurrent depressive disorder, current severe episode without psychotic symptoms
\n<Psychiatric and Somatic Comorbid Diagnoses>
* F90.0 ADHD (external diagnosis), simple activity and attention disorder
* History of F10.0 Mental and behavioral disorders due to alcohol, acute intoxication
* Arterial hypertension
\n<Admission Circumstances>
Presented to the Insel psychiatric emergency service on referral from Dr. Zwanghaft,
accompanied by his wife on a voluntary basis.
Transferred from there by taxi to UPD Bolligenstrasse.
\n<Summary of History>
Mr. Eggli reported experiencing stress at work upon admission. He has felt overwhelmed since the summer, has had to work many extra hours, and felt like he had hardly any free time. He has not felt joy for months, possibly years, and is just surviving. Recently, he has had to force himself to go to work as he no longer had the motivation.
To self-medicate and remain active, he increasingly consumed stimulants (approximately 60 mg of methylphenidate orally per day).
Initially, he was prescribed these by the Concentration Center two years ago, but now he obtains the medication illicitly on the street.
He took a vacation and was glad to finally have time for himself. He would have preferred to stay at home and rest but noticed that he was deteriorating and needed help. Regarding his current condition, he suffers most from fatigue, lack of drive, and persistently low mood. He hopes things will improve soon.
\n<Previous Psychiatric History>
Single outpatient consultation with psychiatrist Dr. Hysterion five years ago (ca. 2019)\n
Plan: <think>
Alright, so I’ve got this user query where they need to split a large document into smaller section

=== Section 2 ===
s, each with fewer than 2024 tokens. The system has two functions: one to count tokens and another to split the text up to a certain character limit.

First off, I think about what exactly needs to be done. The goal is to take this big document and make it manageable by breaking it into chunks where each chunk doesn’t exceed 2023 tokens when tokenized. That makes sense because handling such a large chunk might be overwhelming or cause performance issues.

I start by considering how the splitting works. The split_document function can take the text and stop at a certain character limit, so maybe I should use that to create sections up to 2024 tokens each. But wait, is it just about characters? No, because token count isn’t linear with characters. So perhaps using the stop parameter as the number of tokens might not work directly.

Hmm, then I think about the count_tokens function. It’s necessary to know exactly how many tokens each section has after splitting. That way, if a split results in a chunk over 2023 tokens, I can handle it appropriately.

So maybe my approach should be iterative. Split the text into sections up to 2024 tokens using split_document, then check each resulting chunk with count_tokens. If any are over, take that chunk and split it again until all are under the limit.

Wait, but how do I know where to stop splitting? The user’s instructions say to use the functions provided. So perhaps in a loop: keep splitting until every section is within 2024 tokens.

I also need to consider that each time a section might still be too big after splitting once, so it has to be split again recursively or iteratively until all are under the limit.

Putting it all together, I think using a while loop makes sense. Start by splitting the entire text into chunks up to 2024 tokens. Then, for each chunk, check if its token count is over. If yes, split that part further and repeat this process until every section meets the requirement.

I should also make sure that after each split, I use count_tokens on each new section to ensure compliance. This way, any section exceeding 2023 tokens gets split again.

So in summary, my plan is:
1. Use split_document to divide the text into sections up to a certain token limit.
2. For each resulting section, check its token count using count_tokens.
3. If a section has more than 2023 tokens, split it further using split_document with an appropriate stop value based on the current context.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all sections are under 2024 tokens.

This should ensure that every part of the document is manageable without exceeding the token limit at any point.
